"""
Class variables are declared inside the class definition (but outside
of any instance methods). Theyâ€™re not tied to any particular instance
of a class. Instead, class variables store their contents on the class
itself, and all objects created from a particular class share access to the
same set of class variables. This means, for example, that modifying
a class variable affects all object instances at the same time.

Instance variables are always tied to a particular object instance.
Their contents are not stored on the class, but on each individual ob-
ject created from the class. Therefore, the contents of an instance vari-
able are completely independent from one object instance to the next.
And so, modifying an instance variable only affects one object instance
at a time.
